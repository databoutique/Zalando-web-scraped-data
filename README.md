## About the website

Founded in 2008, [Zalando](https://www.zalando.com/) is an online fashion and lifestyle platform based in Berlin, Germany. The company was birthed out of an idea by Robert Gentz and David Schneider after a failed attempt to operate an online flip-flop business in Latin America. They replotted their course and launched Zalando, originally as an online shoe retailer, inspired by US-based Zappos. The company later broadened its offerings to include clothing, accessories, and beauty products as well. In 2014, Zalando became listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol [ZAL](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ZAL:GR). At its Initial Public Offering (IPO) on October 1, 2014, the companys market capitalization was approximately 6 billion euros.

[Zalando](https://www.zalando.com/) operates in a highly competitive environment, with several key players driving the online fashion and lifestyle sector. Major competitors include traditional brick-and-mortar retailer turned online powerhouse [H&M](https://www2.hm.com/en_us/index.html) ([Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%26M), [Bloomberg page](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/HMB:SS)) and purely online companies such as [ASOS](https://www.asos.com/) ([Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASOS_(company)), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ASC:LN)) and [Boohoo](https://www.boohoo.com/) ([Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boohoo.com), [Bloomberg page](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BOO:LN)). Each of these competitors has a different approach to targeting and serving the fashion-conscious consumer.
